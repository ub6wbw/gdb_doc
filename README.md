=== GDB Logging ===

    You may want to save the output of gdb commands to a file. There are several commands to control gdb's logging.

    set logging on - Enable logging.

    set logging off - Disable logging.

    set logging file file - Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.

    set logging overwrite [on|off]

    By default, gdb will append to the logfile. Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

    set logging redirect [on|off]

    By default, gdb output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

    show logging

    Show the current values of the logging settings.
