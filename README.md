=== GDB Logging ===

    You may want to save the output of gdb commands to a file. There are several commands to control gdb's logging.

    set logging on - Enable logging.

    set logging off - Disable logging.

    set logging file file - Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is gdb.txt.

    set logging overwrite [on|off] - By default, gdb will append to the logfile.
    Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

    set logging redirect [on|off] - By default, gdb output will go to both the terminal and the logfile.
    Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

    show logging - Show the current values of the logging settings.
